Anime City uses Google OAuth and JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization. This allows the user to create a brand new account, or login with an existing Google account and safely store the password without having to share any sensitive data with Anime City.

Once logged in, as a user you'll be able to utilize the full power of the Jikan API to query the Crunchyroll anime database for your favorite shows and movies. You can then make unique lists of movies and shows to suit your tastes, read summaries of the individual results returned from your search, read reviews, see what others have added to their lists, and even link to web locations to watch your favorite movies, shows, or episodes.
